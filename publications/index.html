To illustrate what we have in mind, we consider the use case where sets of simultaneously collected time series that represent latency measurements over time between different pairs of routers or vantage points within a network (e.g., ESnet) are used to define that network’s dynamically changing delay space. By representing successive snapshots of this delay space as 2D manifolds in 3D and animating the resulting manifold views, we transform the information contained in all the simultaneously collected time series into a visualization that effectively shows how a network “breathes” and that can be directly used for diagnosing aspects of a network’s health.</em></p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge" style="background-color: purple;">ACM HotNets</abbr></div> <div id="hotnets2025_sisyphus" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The Internet as Sisyphus: Repeating Measurements, Missing Causes</div> <div class="author"> <strong>Loqman Salamatian</strong> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the 24th ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks</em> Sep 2025 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p><em>Internet measurement has prioritized what can be observed—latency spikes, packet loss, route changes—over why those observations occur. But as the Internet grows in complexity, with opaque interdomain policies, adaptive overlays, and multi-layered feedback loops, purely observational techniques are increasingly inadequate to answer questions that operators care about. When performance degrades or routes shift, we often lack the tools to distinguish causes like a congested link from coincidental correlations driven by unrelated time, varying load, measurement bias, or background churn. As a result, explanations remain speculative, and operators struggle to decide whether and how to intervene. This paper explores how causal inference can help fill that gap. We show how classical measurement questions can be framed and analyzed using tools like instrumental variables, causal graphs, and synthetic controls. We illustrate the approach through a case study evaluating whether IXP reduces end-user latency locally. We also revisit recent studies where confounding blurred key conclusions, showing how causal framing could clarify design and interpretation.

In this paper, we more accurately characterize the False Positive dynamics of Bloom Filters as they are commonly used in networking applications. In particular, network applications often utilize a Bloom Filter that “recycles”: it repeatedly fills, and upon reaching a certain level of saturation, empties and fills again. In this context, it makes more sense to evaluate performance using the average False Positive rate instead of the worst case bound. We show how to efficiently compute the average False Positive rate of recycling Bloom Filter variants via renewal and Markov models. We apply our models to both the standard Bloom Filter and a “two-phase” variant, verify the accuracy of our model with simulations, and find that the previous analysis’ worst-case formulation leads to up to a 30% reduction in the efficiency of Bloom Filter when applied in network applications, while two-phase overhead diminishes as the needed False Positive rate is tightened.</em></p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge" style="background-color: purple;">ACM SIGMETRICS</abbr></div> <div id="10.1145/3656005" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Analysis of False Negative Rates for Recycling Bloom Filters (Yes, They Happen!)</div> <div class="author">Kahlil Dozier,  <strong>Loqman Salamatian</strong>, and <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~danr/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dan Rubenstein</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Proc.

To keep false positive rates below a reasonable threshold, applications periodically "recycle" the Bloom Filter, clearing the memory and then resuming the tracking of data. After a recycle point, subsequent arrivals of recycled messages are likely to be misclassified as new; recycling induces false negatives. Despite numerous applications of recycling, the corresponding false negative rates have never been analyzed. In this paper, we derive approximations, upper bounds, and lower bounds of false negative rates for several variants of recycling Bloom Filters. These approximations and bounds are functions of the size of memory used to store the Bloom Filter and the distributions on new arrivals and repeat messages, and can be efficiently computed on conventional hardware. We show, via comparison to simulation, that our upper bounds and approximations are extremely tight, and can be efficiently computed for megabyte-sized Bloom Filters on conventional hardware.</em></p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge" style="background-color: purple;">ACM HotNets</abbr></div> <div id="10.1145/3696348.3696891" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Toward Applying Quantum Computing to Network Verification</div> <div class="author">Kahlil Dozier, Justin Beltran, Kylie Berg, Hugo Matousek,  <strong>Loqman Salamatian</strong>, <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/~ebk2141/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ethan Katz-Bassett</a>, and <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~danr/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dan Rubenstein</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the The 23rd ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks</em> Nov 2024 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://burdantes.github.io/assets/pdf/hotnets2024_quantum_computing.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0 btn-primary" role="button" style="background-color: #dc3545; border-color: #dc3545; margin-right: 5px;">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p><em>Network verification, broadly defined as proving the correctness of certain properties resulting from a network’s configuration, cannot be efficiently solved on classical hardware via brute force.

In this paper, we consider a radically different approach: applying quantum computing to more efficiently solve network verification problems. We provide an overview of how to map variants of verification problems into unstructured search problems that can be solved via quantum computing with quadratic speedup, making the approach feasible in theory to problems that twice as big in the size of the input. Emerging quantum systems cannot yet tackle problems of practical interest, but rapid advances in hardware and algorithm development make now a great time to start thinking about their application.

As an alternative, some recent studies have used the APNIC per AS Population Estimates dataset, but it is unvalidated and its methodology is not fully public. In this work, we validate its use as a fairly reliable user population indicator. Our approach includes a detailed comparative analysis using a global CDN dataset, providing concrete evidence of the APNIC dataset’s accuracy. We find that the APNIC per-AS user estimates closely align with the Content Delivery Network (CDN) per-AS user estimates in 51.2% of countries and correctly identify the largest networks in 93.9% of cases. When we investigate the agreement with CDN traffic volume, the APNIC dataset closely aligns in 36.5% of countries, increasing to 91.0% when focusing only on larger networks. We also evaluate the limitations of the APNIC dataset, particularly its inability to accurately identify user populations for ASes in certain countries.

This approach allows metAScritic to accurately reconstruct the complete peering connectivity by measuring a strategic subset of interconnections that capture ASes’ underlying peering strategies.

In response to these developments, we present a new empirical approach for elucidating connectivity in these private backbone networks. Our approach relies on using only "lightweight" (i.e., simple, easily interpretable, and readily available) measurements, but requires applying "heavyweight" mathematical techniques for analyzing these measurements. In particular, we describe a new method that uses network latency measurements and relies on concepts from Riemannian geometry (i.e., Ricci curvature) to assess the characteristics of the connectivity fabric of a given network infrastructure. We complement this method with a visualization tool that generates a novel manifold view of a network’s delay space. We demonstrate our approach by utilizing latency measurements from available vantage points and virtual machines running in datacenters of three large cloud providers to study different aspects of connectivity in their private backbones and show how our generated manifold views enable us to expose and visualize critical aspects of this connectivity.</em></p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge" style="background-color: purple;">ACM CCR</abbr></div> <div id="10.1145/3594255.3594260" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Who Squats IPv4 Addresses?</div> <div class="author"> <strong>Loqman Salamatian</strong>, Todd Arnold, Ítalo Cunha, Jiangchen Zhu, Yunfan Zhang, <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/~ebk2141/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ethan Katz-Bassett</a>, and Matt Calder </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>SIGCOMM Comput.

In addition to shining light on a dirty secret of operational practices, our paper shows that squatting distorts common Internet measurement methodologies, which we argue have to be re-examined to account for squat space.</em></p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2022</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge" style="background-color: purple;">ACM IMC</abbr></div> <div id="10.1145/3517745.3561443" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">IGDB: Connecting the Physical and Logical Layers of the Internet</div> <div class="author">Scott Anderson,  <strong>Loqman Salamatian</strong>, Zachary S.

Our approach is constructive and uses geographic location as the key feature for linking physical and logical layers. We begin by building a representation of physical connectivity using online sources to identify locations that house transport hardware (i.e., PoPs, colocation centers, IXPs, etc.), and approximate locations of links between these based on shortest-path rights-of-way. We then utilize standard data sources for generating maps of IP-level and AS-level logical connectivity, and graft these onto physical maps using geographic anchors. We implement our methodology in an open-source framework called the Internet Geographic Database (iGDB), which includes tools for updating measurement data and assuring internal consistency. iGDB is built to be used with ArcGIS, a geographic information system that provides broad capability for spatial analysis and visualization. We describe the details of the iGDB implementation and demonstrate how it can be used in a variety of settings.</em></p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge" style="background-color: purple;">ACM SIGMETRICS</abbr></div> <div id="10.1145/3508025" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Curvature-Based Analysis of Network Connectivity in Private Backbone Infrastructures</div> <div class="author"> <strong>Loqman Salamatian</strong>, Scott Anderson, Joshua Matthews, Paul Barford, Walter Willinger, and Mark Crovella </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Proc.

In response to these developments, we present a new empirical approach for elucidating private connectivity in today’s Internet. Our approach relies on using only "light-weight" ( i.e., simple, easily-interpretable, and readily available) measurements, but requires applying a "heavy-weight" or advanced mathematical analysis. In particular, we describe a new method for assessing the characteristics of network path connectivity that is based on concepts from Riemannian geometry ( i.e., Ricci curvature) and also relies on an array of carefully crafted visualizations ( e.g., a novel manifold view of a network’s delay space). We demonstrate our method by utilizing latency measurements from RIPE Atlas anchors and virtual machines running in data centers of three large cloud providers to (i) study different aspects of connectivity in their private backbones and (ii) show how our manifold-based view enables us to expose and visualize critical aspects of this connectivity over different geographic scales.</em></p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2021</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge" style="background-color: purple;">Journal of Cybersecurity</abbr></div> <div id="salamatian2021geopolitics" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The geopolitics behind the routes data travel: a case study of Iran</div> <div class="author"> <strong>Loqman Salamatian</strong>, Frédérick Douzet, Kavé Salamatian, and Kévin Limonier </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Journal of Cybersecurity</em> Feb 2021 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://burdantes.github.io/assets/pdf/joc2021_iran_geopolitics.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0 btn-primary" role="button" style="background-color: #dc3545; border-color: #dc3545; margin-right: 5px;">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p><em>In November 2019, in the wake of political demonstrations against the regime, Iran managed to selectively cut off most traffic from the global Internet while fully operating its own domestic network. It seemingly confirmed the main hypothesis our research had led us to, based on prior observation of data routing: Iran’s architecture of connectivity enables selective censorship of international traffic. This paper examines, through the case of Iran, how states can leverage the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) as a tool of geopolitical control and what are the trade-offs they face. This question raises a methodological question that we also address: how the analysis of BGP can infer and document these strategies of territorialization of cyberspace. The Internet is a network of networks where each network is an autonomous system. Autonomous systems (ASes) are independent administrative entities controlled by a variety of actors such as governments, companies and universities. Their administrators have to agree and communicate on the path followed by packets travelling across the Internet, which is made possible by BGP. Agreements between ASes are often confidential but BGP requires neighbouring ASes to interact with each other in order to coordinate routing through the constant release of connectivity update messages. These messages announce the availability (or withdrawal) of a sequence of ASes that can be followed to reach an IP address prefix. In our study, we inferred the structure of Iran’s connectivity through the capture and analysis of these BGP announcements. We show how the particularities of Iran’s BGP and connectivity structure can enable active measures, such as censorship, both internally and externally throughout the network. We argue that Iran has found a way to reconcile a priori conflicting strategic goals: developing a self-sustaining and resilient domestic Internet, but with tight control at its borders. It thus enables the regime to leverage connectivity as a tool of censorship in the face of social instability and as a tool of regional influence in the context of strategic competition.</em></p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge" style="background-color: purple;">First Monday</abbr></div> <div id="limonier2021mapping" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Mapping the routes of the Internet for geopolitics: the case of Eastern Ukraine</div> <div class="author">Kevin Limonier, Frédérick Douzet, Louis Pétiniaud,  <strong>Loqman Salamatian</strong>, and Kave Salamatian </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>First Monday</em> Feb 2021 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://burdantes.github.io/assets/pdf/firstmonday2021_eastern_ukraine.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0 btn-primary" role="button" style="background-color: #dc3545; border-color: #dc3545; margin-right: 5px;">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p><em>In this paper, we argue that data routing is of geopolitical significance.

In our study, we conducted a longitudinal analysis of Ukraine’s connectivity through the capture and analysis of these BGP announcements. Our results show how Donbass ASes progressively migrated from Ukraine’s cyberspace towards Russia, while still sharing connections with Ukrainian ASes. Donbass cyberspace therefore sits at the interface of Ukraine and Russia but has been relegated to the periphery of both networks; it is marginalized from the Ukrainian network but not fully integrated into the Russian network. These evolutions both reflect and affect ongoing geopolitical power rivalries in the physical world and demonstrate their strategic significance.

Our hypothesis was that BGP could be used for geopolitical reasons in the context of a large-scale crisis, leading to a further fragmentation of the Internet. We focused on the Ukrainian crisis.BGP is a core protocol of cyberspace that connects the tens of thousands of autonomous systems (ASes) that compose the Internet. Based on a 35-year-old technology, this protocol is easy to manipulate to re-route Internet traffic or even to cut off entire regions (BGP hijacks). Our results show actions on BGP implemented right after the 2014 Maidan Revolution, when Russian forces took control of the Crimean Peninsula and started to back separatist forces in Eastern Ukraine. In both cases, Russian authorities and separatist forces modified BGP routes in order to divert the local Internet traffic from continental Ukraine – drawing a kind of "digital frontline" consistent with the military one. The study of Donbass and of the Crimean Peninsula leads to important methodological findings to (1) define and map digital borders at the routing level; (2) analyze the strategies of actors conducting actions via BGP; (3) categorize these strategies, from traffic re-routing to cutting-off entire regions for intelligence or military purposes; and (4) anticipate future uses for BGP manipulations by identifying strategic bottlenecks within the network.</em></p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge" style="background-color: purple;">Espace Pol</abbr></div> <div id="petiniaud2020role" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Le rôle de la topologie d’Internet dans les territoires en conflit en Ukraine, une approche géopolitique du routage des données</div> <div class="author">Louis Pétiniaud, and <strong>Loqman Salamatian</strong> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>L’Espace Politique.

They are group of routers interconnected by the same administrative control (Internet Service Providers, Content Providers, companies, public services etc.) that interconnect to each other to form the Internet as a whole. By establishing connection agreements between themselves via the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), ASes allow data to flow from one point to another around the globe. In this article, we aim to understand how the aspect of the routing of data can be decisive in how we consider both the relationship between Internet and territory, and the impact of the structure of the Internet on territorial conflicts. Much literature has addressed the relationship between space and the Internet, both in geography and geopolitics. The increasing digitization of various aspects of society (Bakis, 2013 ; Cattaruzza, 2019) was first accompanied by comments about a paradigm shift of the concepts of geography (Virilio, 1997) or sovereignty (Camilleri, Falk, 1992). The relationship between space and Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) has also been considered under the angle of infrastructures and their territorial integration (Lasserre, 2000) More recently, Beaude (2012) and Loveluck (2015) have shown how the complex interactions between Internet and society, produced alternative forms of space. Increasingly, the many dimensions of the Internet and of digitization are considered a salient feature of the social construction of territories, and therefore of geopolitical conflicts (Douzet, 2014). We draw from this literature to illustrate how the network of Autonomous Systems is linked to territorial conflicts. The behavior of autonomous systems, and in particular their integration within the rest of the network, responds to geopolitical constraints. The choice of an AS’s administrators to connect to some ASes and not others, or the way they design and implement routing policies are subject to commercial, political, geographical and legal decisions. The construction of this topology then alters territories, especially disputed ones, and the power rivalries that apply to it. We show that this network is emblematic of the duality of the Internet between topography and topology. This study aims at understanding the role AS topology can play in the traditional power struggle. By selecting the paths through which data flows, administrators of AS bring out territories and new forms of « power-topology » (Allen, 2011). Our methodology combines elements of geopolitics and technical sciences (Internet measurements, network theory) and is based on quantitative approaches. We use data of interdomain connectivity gathered through BGP monitors that allow us to create graphs showing the interconnections between autonomous systems. We use an empirical approach to read the output graphs on a specific case study: disputed territories in Ukraine. The territories of Donbass and Crimea are ideal case studies in that the dispute over them is rather new, which allow us to observe with detail the changes in the topology of their networks over time. They also represent two different types of disputed territories. While Crimea was annexed by the Russian Federation in March 2014, the Donbass region is home to the two self-proclaimed People’s Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk, and is actively fighting against the central government of Ukraine with the help of Russia. By looking at the stakeholders of connectivity in these territories and their evolution, we show how the Internet is embedded into dynamics of changing sovereignty. In fact, the technical infrastructures of the Internet highlight a new vector of Russian power. The evolution of the routing topology indicates that Crimea is now fully dependent on Russia to connect to the Internet, and Donbass is following the same path.</em></p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge" style="background-color: purple;">Espace Pol</abbr></div> <div id="gerard2020rt" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">RT, Sputnik et le mouvement des Gilets jaunes: cartographie des communautés politiques sur Twitter</div> <div class="author">Colin Gérard, Guilhem Marotte, and <strong>Loqman Salamatian</strong> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>L’Espace Politique.

This strategy, based on a massive presence on social networks, is at the heart of new power struggles between states. In France, Russian state-funded media RT and Sputnik are thus regularly blamed for their editorial policy, which many political and media actors consider as partial or misleading. The Yellow Vests movement, whose members have been accused of being manipulated by Russia and its media, illustrates this observation. While a growing number of publications has focused on the actors of Russian informational influence and the narratives they deploy (Yablokov, 2015; Audinet, 2018, 2020 ; Hutchings, 2020), the question of the reception and the propagation of content produced by these actors on different networks remain unanswered – mainly because of difficulties in accessing to social network data – despite recent efforts (Fisher, 2020). This article therefore proposes to draw up a mapping of the political communities that disseminate the contents of the international Russian media. This cartography is based on data collected on Twitter during the first months of the Yellow Vests movement. The approach we propose here is inspired by the work published by Gaumont et al. which shows that it is possible, through data from Twitter, and especially retweets, to qualify and quantify the activity of political communities, as well as their evolution and reconfiguration over time (Gaumont et al, 2018). Our methodology to map content published by the Russian media is directly in line with the work of Limonier and Pétiniaud (2018), who focused on a part of the "pro-Russian" community of the French-speaking segment of Twitter, as well as on the way this community relayed the MacronLeaks during the between-two rounds of the French presidential election of 2017. Our results first show that content produced by the Russian state-media are relatively popular across a broad spectrum of the French political landscape, from left-leaning to far-right parties. Then, we observe that Yellow Vest communities are distinguished by their weak presence and dispersal within the graph, which confirm the hypothesis that this movement was not formed and structured on Twitter but on Facebook (Sebbah et al, 2018). If the protest movement has indeed been the subject of a very high volume of publications for several months on Twitter, this platform seems to have been only a media and political soundbox, rather than a space for structuring and organizing the different groups of Yellow Vests.</em></p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2019</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge" style="background-color: purple;">RIPE Labs</abbr></div> <div id="petiniaud2019geopolitics" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Geopolitics of routing</div> <div class="author">Louis Pétiniaud, and <strong>Loqman Salamatian</strong> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>RIPE Network Coordination Center: https://labs. ripe. net/Members/louis_petiniaud/geopolitics-of-routing</em> Feb 2019 </div> <div class="links"> <a href="https://burdantes.github.io/assets/pdf/ripelabs2019_geopolitics_routing.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0 btn-primary" role="button" style="background-color: #dc3545; border-color: #dc3545; margin-right: 5px;">PDF</a> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2018</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge" style="background-color: purple;">ArXiv</abbr></div> <div id="salamatian2018geometric" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A geometric approach for real-time monitoring of dynamic large scale graphs: AS-level graphs illustrated</div> <div class="author"> <strong>Loqman Salamatian</strong>, Dali Kaafar, and Kavé Salamatian </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.00676</em> Feb 2018 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://burdantes.github.io/assets/pdf/arxiv2018_geometric_monitoring.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0 btn-primary" role="button" style="background-color: #dc3545; border-color: #dc3545; margin-right: 5px;">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p><em>The monitoring of large dynamic networks is a major challenge for a wide range of application. The complexity stems from properties of the underlying graphs, in which slight local changes can lead to sizable variations of global properties, e.g., under certain conditions, a single link cut that may be overlooked during monitoring can result in splitting the graph into two disconnected components. Moreover, it is often difficult to determine whether a change will propagate globally or remain local. Traditional graph theory measure such as the centrality or the assortativity of the graph are not satisfying to characterize global properties of the graph. In this paper, we tackle the problem of real-time monitoring of dynamic large scale graphs by developing a geometric approach that leverages notions of geometric curvature and recent development in graph embeddings using Ollivier-Ricci curvature [47]. We illustrate the use of our method by considering the practical case of monitoring dynamic variations of global Internet using topology changes information provided by combining several BGP feeds. In particular, we use our method to detect major events and changes via the geometry of the embedding of the graph. We first adapt the Ricci curvature to characterize the AS level graph. The key idea is to detect changes in between consecutive snapshots and to separate events that result in considerable geometric alterations, from those that remain local. The variations of curvature are evaluated through a set of landmarks as reference points. We develop an anomaly tracking mechanism to detect large variations of curvature that translate into major variations in the geometry of the graph. These changes are then considered as major BGP level events. In a second stage, we describe a mechanism for identifying the network elements responsible for the set of coordinated changes and isolate their geometric implications. We evaluate this system in operational settings and show its performance in real-life scenarios</em></p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-ka7Sk0Gln4gmtz2MlQnikT1wXgYsOg+OMhuP+IlRH9sENBO0LRn5q+8nbTov4+1p" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js.map" integrity="sha384-ka7Sk0Gln4gmtz2MlQnikT1wXgYsOg+OMhuP+IlRH9sENBO0LRn5q+8nbTov4+1p" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/masonry-layout@4.2.2/dist/masonry.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-Nn1q/fx0H7SNLZMQ5Hw5JLaTRZp0yILA/FRexe19VdI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/imagesloaded@4/imagesloaded.pkgd.min.js"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/masonry.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/medium-zoom@1.0.8/dist/medium-zoom.min.js" integrity="sha256-7PhEpEWEW0XXQ0k6kQrPKwuoIomz8R8IYyuU1Qew4P8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/zoom.js"></script> <script defer src="https://unpkg.com/bootstrap-table@1.21.4/dist/bootstrap-table.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/no_defer.js?d633890033921b33e0ceb13d22340a9c"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/common.js?79834af4f28864bc7f434817c7605e1b"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/copy_code.js?c9d9dd48933de3831b3ee5ec9c209cac" type="text/javascript"></script> <script async src="https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js"></script> <script async src="https://badge.dimensions.ai/badge.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">window.MathJax={tex:{tags:"ams"}};</script> <script defer type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.0/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script> <script defer src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script> <script type="text/javascript">function progressBarSetup(){"max"in document.createElement("progress")?(initializeProgressElement(),$(document).on("scroll",function(){progressBar.attr({value:getCurrentScrollPosition()})}),$(window).on("resize",initializeProgressElement)):(resizeProgressBar(),$(document).on("scroll",resizeProgressBar),$(window).on("resize",resizeProgressBar))}function getCurrentScrollPosition(){return $(window).scrollTop()}function initializeProgressElement(){let e=$("#navbar").outerHeight(!0);$("body").css({"padding-top":e}),$("progress-container").css({"padding-top":e}),progressBar.css({top:e}),progressBar.attr({max:getDistanceToScroll(),value:getCurrentScrollPosition()})}function getDistanceToScroll(){return $(document).height()-$(window).height()}function resizeProgressBar(){progressBar.css({width:getWidthPercentage()+"%"})}function getWidthPercentage(){return getCurrentScrollPosition()/getDistanceToScroll()*100}const progressBar=$("#progress");window.onload=function(){setTimeout(progressBarSetup,50)};</script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/particles.js@2.0.0/particles.min.js" onload="console.log('✅ particles.js loaded');" onerror="console.error('❌ failed to load /assets/js/particles.js');"></script> <script>!function e(){return document.getElementById("particles-js")&&window.particlesJS?void particlesJS("particles-js",{particles:{number:{value:110,density:{enable:!0,value_area:800}},color:{value:"#374151"},shape:{type:"circle"},opacity:{value:.6,random:!1},size:{value:3.6,random:!0},line_linked:{enable:!0,distance:130,color:"#4b5563",opacity:.5,width:1.2},move:{enable:!0,speed:1,direction:"none",out_mode:"out"}},interactivity:{detect_on:"window",events:{onhover:{enable:!0,mode:"repulse"},onclick:{enable:!1}},modes:{repulse:{distance:140,duration:.4}}},retina_detect:!0}):setTimeout(e,50)}();</script> </body> </html>
