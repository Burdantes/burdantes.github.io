# Teaching & Mentoring Experience

## Teaching Service

I served twice as a Course Assistant for [CSEEW6180 Modeling Performance Evaluation](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~misra/6180.html) with Professor Vishal Misra. My duties included:

- Drafting and grading homework assignments
- Overseeing final examinations
- Conducting office hours and providing student support
- Assisting with course material development

## Mentoring

Over recent years, I've had the honor of mentoring several exceptional undergraduate scholars on diverse research topics:

### Current Mentees

- **Tani Omoyeni** (Fall 2025-): Researching how changes in speed-test activity can be used as a signal to detect Internet outages worldwide.

### Recent Mentees

- **Ike Schmit** (Summer 2025 - September 2025): Analyzed throughput measurement from Filecoin.

- **Kylie Berg** (Summer 2023 - Summer 2025): Focused on quantum networking verification and quantum computing applications in network verification problems.

- **Seung Joon Rhee** (Summer 2023 - September 2024): Measured and geolocated hypergiant peering connections, contributing to our understanding of Internet topology.

- **Dominic Sobhani** (Summer 2022 - Spring 2023): Developed a transformer architecture to simulate Internet traffic data, exploring machine learning applications in network modeling.

- **Alfonso Luis** (Fall 2022 - Spring 2023): Researched sampling without replacement and Bloom Filters, contributing to our work on probabilistic data structures.

- **Joshua Hahn** (Summer 2022 - Fall 2022): Worked on emulating causal models and understanding how synthetic control recovers underlying latent spaces.

- **Cyrus Illick** (Fall 2021 - Spring 2023): Developed a new protocol to avoid broadcasting storms. Starting Ph.D. at Columbia University in Fall 2023.
