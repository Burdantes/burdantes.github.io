# Teaching & Mentoring Experience

## Teaching Service

I served twice as a Course Assistant for [CSEEW6180 Modeling Performance Evaluation](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~misra/6180.html) with Professor Vishal Misra. My duties included:

- Drafting and grading homework assignments
- Overseeing final examinations
- Conducting office hours and providing student support
- Assisting with course material development

## Mentoring

Over recent years, I've had the honor of mentoring several exceptional undergraduate scholars on diverse research topics:

### Current Mentees

- **Kylie Berg** (Summer 2023 - June 2025): Focused on quantum networking verification and quantum computing applications in network verification problems.

### Recent Mentees

- **Seung Joon Rhee** (Summer 2023 - September 2024): Inferred and geolocated hypergiant peering connections, contributing to our understanding of Internet topology.

- **Dominic Sobhani** (Summer 2022 - Spring 2023): Developed a transformer architecture to simulate Internet traffic data, exploring machine learning applications in network modeling.

- **Alfonso Luis** (Fall 2022 - Spring 2023): Researched sampling without replacement and Bloom Filters, contributing to our work on probabilistic data structures.

- **Joshua Hahn** (Summer 2022 - Fall 2022): Worked on emulating causal models and understanding how synthetic control recovers underlying latent spaces.

- **Cyrus Illick** (Fall 2021 - Spring 2023): Developed a new protocol to avoid broadcasting storms. Starting Ph.D. at Columbia University in Fall 2023.

## Mentoring Philosophy

I believe in providing hands-on research experience that allows students to contribute meaningfully to ongoing projects while developing their own research skills. My approach focuses on:

- **Collaborative Research**: Working alongside students on real research problems
- **Skill Development**: Building both technical and analytical capabilities
- **Academic Growth**: Preparing students for graduate school and research careers
- **Diverse Topics**: Exposing students to various aspects of networking and systems research

## Research Areas for Mentoring

Students working with me typically engage in research related to:

- Internet measurement and topology discovery
- Mathematical modeling of network systems
- Machine learning applications in networking
- Quantum computing applications in network verification
- Probabilistic data structures and algorithms
- Network visualization and analysis

## Contact

If you are interested in research projects or have questions about graduate school, feel free to reach out! I'm always excited to work with motivated students who are passionate about networking and systems research.
