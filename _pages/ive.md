## Overview

As the Internet grows more complex, diverse, and deeply embedded in society, visualization plays an increasingly vital role in understanding its structure, behavior, and evolution. From classic time series to immersive interactive maps, visual tools help expose anomalies, reveal hidden geometries, and make abstract patterns tangible. The Internet Visualization Exhibition (IVE) celebrates this creative dimension of Internet research. IVE invites researchers, practitioners, and artists to share novel visualizations, images, animations, and interactive artifacts, that distill insight from data, make Internet infrastructure more legible an elucidate details of complex systems and protocols. IVE also aims to foster dialogue between disciplines, promote visual thinking as a research skill, and inspire new ways of representing complexity at Internet scale.

## Why an Internet Visualization Exhibition?

Visualization is a powerful bridge between raw data and human insight. Classic plots and charts have long helped us understand key concepts, spot trends, anomalies, and highlight patterns.  Innovative visualizations can expose hidden geometries, reveal unexpected behaviors, and make abstract phenomena tangible—not just for experts, but for broader audiences as well.  In some cases, visualizations can become the most memorable aspect of a research study and become the standard by which future papers present results and findings.

We’re organizing the Internet Visualization Exhibition (IVE) to celebrate and advance this creative dimension of Internet research. Our goal is to foster a culture where visual thinking is valued as a core research skill, and where new perspectives and techniques are shared across disciplines. By bringing together researchers, practitioners, and artists, we hope to inspire fresh approaches to representing Internet-scale systems and to spark conversations that lead to deeper understanding and new discoveries.

## How to Participate

This session will showcase creative visualizations, animations or other representations of Internet data, topoolgy, systems, and protocols.  We’re looking for bold new contributions that convey insights that may not be possible with current techniques or that just look cool.  The format for this session will be diverse – it may include posters or projected video accompanied by optional creator commentary, followed by an informal discussion where contributors and attendees can share reflections on visualization as a research practice: what works, what challenges arise, and what opportunities lie ahead.  If you’ve got something innovative, please [submit](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1NAuqwefNez5JSXsE-9NhGJqalm4_J-p3SamjFZjPA2I/edit)!
