ðŸŽ¨ **Organizing Internet Visualization Exhibition (IVE) at SIGCOMM 2025!** I'm excited to announce that I'm co-organizing the Internet Visualization Exhibition (IVE) with Paul Barford (University of Wisconsin) at SIGCOMM 2025. This non-paper session celebrates the creative dimension of Internet measurement and systems research, inviting researchers, practitioners, and artists to share novel visualizations, images, animations, and interactive artifacts that make Internet infrastructure more legible. The exhibition is now sponsored by the Internet Society and will award a prize for the best visualization!
