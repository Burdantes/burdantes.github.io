**On the Academic Job Market!** I am currently seeking faculty positions in Computer Science, with a focus on Internet measurement, networking, and systems research. I will be defending my Ph.D. thesis in Spring 2025 and am excited to contribute to the academic community through research, teaching, and mentoring. Please reach out if you have opportunities or would like to discuss my research!
