**Two papers accepted on Recycling Bloom Filters!** I am pleased to announce that our two papers with Kahlil Dozier and Dan Rubenstein on estimating the upper and lower-bound of false positive and negative rates of Recycling Bloom Filters have been accepted at IEEE INFOCOM 2024 (for the false positive) and ACM SIGMETRICS 2024 (for the false negative).
